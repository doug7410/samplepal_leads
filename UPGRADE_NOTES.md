# Email System Upgrade Notes

## Overview

We've replaced the custom `SesMailService` with Laravel's built-in mail utilities and switched from Amazon SES to Resend as the email provider while maintaining all the existing functionality for tracking opens, clicks, and other email events.

## Changes Made

1. **New Classes Added:**
   - `MailService`: A drop-in replacement for `SesMailService` that uses Laravel's built-in Mail facade
   - `CampaignMail`: A Laravel Mailable class for sending campaign emails
   - `EmailEventHandler`: An event listener to handle MessageSent events from Laravel's mail system
   - `EventServiceProvider`: Registers the event listeners for mail events

2. **Bindings and Providers:**
   - Added a binding in `AppServiceProvider` to map `SesMailService` to our new `MailService` 
   - Registered the `EventServiceProvider` in `bootstrap/providers.php`

3. **Mail Driver Configuration:**
   - Added Resend PHP SDK as a dependency
   - Configured Resend as the default mail driver
   - Added necessary configuration for Resend in `config/services.php`

4. **Webhook Handling:**
   - Renamed webhook routes and methods to be provider-agnostic
   - Updated webhook signature verification for Resend
   - Enhanced metadata extraction from email headers

## Benefits

1. **Standard Laravel Patterns:** Uses Laravel's Mailable classes and event system for better maintainability
2. **Better Testing:** Easier to mock and test with standard Laravel mail testing utilities
3. **Flexibility:** Can easily switch mail drivers through config without code changes
4. **Future-Proof:** Follows Laravel 12 patterns for easier upgrades
5. **Improved Deliverability:** Resend offers excellent deliverability rates and detailed analytics
6. **Modern API:** Resend provides a more modern and developer-friendly API compared to SES

## Testing

Please test all email-related functionality including:

1. Sending campaign emails
2. Open tracking
3. Click tracking 
4. Webhook handling for SES events
5. Campaign statistics

## Configuration

You'll need to update your environment variables to use Resend. A sample configuration file `.env.resend.example` has been provided with the required and optional settings. The main requirements are:

1. Setting `MAIL_MAILER=resend` in your `.env` file
2. Getting a Resend API key from [resend.com](https://resend.com) and setting `RESEND_KEY`
3. Optional: Configure webhooks in the Resend dashboard to point to your `/email/webhook` endpoint

See `.env.resend.example` for all configuration options.
